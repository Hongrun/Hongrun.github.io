I bought this book a little less than a month ago but didn't really had time to read it untill now. I really like this book. It is organized in a very efficient way, touching on all aspects of data structure, concepts and algorithms and advanced topics. It also contains a lot of problems which are really fundamental and beginner-friendly along with detailed solutions to these problems. I have gone through the first four chapters on data structure already and organized my notes into this post.
