I am very excited to start this blog just before my 20th birthday. I have been a programmer for a year and a half now. My journey into programming has not been easy, but definitely rewarding and enjoyable. I liked it so much that I decided to start writing about it and share it with the world.

This blog is built using a jekyll template I found on github.
